Woodstox is dual-licensed under 2 alternative Open Source/Free licenses:
LGPL 2.1 and Apache License 2.0. (starting with Woodstox 2.0 release).
This is because of perceived incompatibility between these two popular
licenses: while I do not agree in that there is a problem (the way I
interpret LGPL, Java class loading is not static linking, ergo
there is no virality), I nonetheless find it easier to just provide
alternative downloads to risk alienating Apache/Jakarta or GPL users.

What this means is that one can choose either one of these licenses
(for purposes of re-distributing Woodstox; usually by including it as
one of jars another application or library uses) by downloading corresponding
jar file, using it, and living happily everafter. With source code
distribution licensing does not matter; except that it is good to know
that by default Ant will build 2 distributions, one under each license.
